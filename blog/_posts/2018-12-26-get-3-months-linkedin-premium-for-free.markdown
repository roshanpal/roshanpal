LinkedIn is the facebook for prefessionals. Anyone working in the IT industry must build your connections on LinkedIn. It comes in handy whenever you are looking for a better opportunity or change in your career. You can get 3 months LinkedIn premium for free by following the steps mentioned in this article.

Recently LinkedIn came up with a premium membership option. If you are a premium member, your profile will be having a lot more visibility than regular profile. When you apply for companies, you will be getting a free boost on your application and you will have a higher chance of landing an interview with the company. The minimum cost of a premium LinkedIn membership is $29.99 USD per month, which is pretty expensive in my opinion. A lot of people who are in the beginning of their career journey may find it difficult to pay every month. The premium membership of LinkedIn comes with other benefits such as LinkedIn Learning which is very useful resource to upgrade your professional skills. This is an added bonus of having a premium membership.
